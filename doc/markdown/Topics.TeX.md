**General Remarks - TeX in Application**

- TeX, such as with application in a LaTeX typesetting system, may be
  considered ideal as a notation for authoring and publication of
  normally structured, principlally narrative literary content.

- In extension with GNU Texinfo tools, TeX -- using the specific Texinfo
  notation -- may be used in production of normally structured technical
  reference documentation. Texinfo has been widely utilized in
  documentation for the Emacs text editing platform.

- TeX may serve, in a manner, as a normal bibliographical notation, _vis
  a vis_ BibTeX notation. BibTeX notation is commonly supported in
  academic publishing services and in a wide range of bibliographical
  reference tools. In a pragmatic regard, BibTeX may serve principally
  for purpoes of representation of textual reference information,
  such as in a manner pursuant to reference citation about articles of
  _The Literature_ in any common field of academic study. Of course,
  BibTeX may find a principal role in TeX authoring systems. BibTeX,
  like much of the broader range of specialized TeX notations, is an
  extensible notation.
